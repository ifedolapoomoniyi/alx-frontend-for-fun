# Sass & Scss

Learning to use the Sass CSS preprocessor as an optional task by Alx.

## Genereal Objectives

- What Sass means.
- Difference between Sass and Scss.
- Basic Sass features eg nesting, variables, mixins, inheritance, operators, functions.
- Project based tasks

> **Note:** Alx uses the deprecated ruby sass 3.7.4 version, in order to keep with the project requirements, I will be using the same version.
